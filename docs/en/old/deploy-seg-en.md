## Background

This deployment guide describes how to deploy **AI Solution Kit - Human Image Segmentation** solution by Amazon CloudFormation templates.

The AI and ML driven applications are maturing rapidly and creating new demands on enterprises, the AI Solution Kit provides diversified leading AI/ML solutions that are easy to use. Customers can easily work with the REST API or software development kit (SDK) provided by AI/ML solution. Based on deep learning model, Human Image Segmentation solution to identify the outline of the person and body-part in the image, to separate it from the background with high accuracy segmentation.

## Solution Description
Once the solution deployed by Amazon CloudFormation template, customers can use this solution feature by calling HTTP (s) or API interfaces, the REST API interface which created by Amazon API Gateway provides customers the AI services and customers can send request (pictures) to the Amazon API Gateway via HTTP POST verb, then the Amazon Lambda function is invoked by the Amazon API Gateway, and returns the Base64 encoded Alpha channel image data after removing the background.

>By using a serverless architecture, such as Amazon Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, serverless works in a pay-as-you-go manner, which means that customers only pay for those resources which they actually use.

## System Architecture
Starting from the API User(s) side, the API user sends an HTTP request to Amazon API Gateway to pass payload parameters. The API Gateway is a layer that provides the RESTful API to the client for the AI applications, in AI Kits solution.

 - Lambda Integration (the first diagram):

The ML models are stored in Amazon EFS, the AI algorithm are implemented in the Lambda function, the Lambda function parses the values from API Gateway and performs model in EFS. After that, it returns a value (JSON format) and sends it back to the API Gateway.


### Architecture diagram
This solution currently supports deployment in Amazon Web Services standard regions.

### Components

**Amazon API Gateway**

- This solution uses API Gateway to route HTTP requests
- To associate the domain name registered by the ICP
- API Gateway can also set a key to authorize the HTTP POST requester

**Amazon Lambda**

- The Lambda function handles the customer's requests for inference.

**Amazon EFS**

- Amazon EFS stores machine learning models based on Lambda pre-training. Lambda functions perform inference calculations by calling models stored in Amazon EFS and return the results to the caller.


## Instance Type
The Human Image Segmentation solution includes two architecture design types based on Lambda functions. When deploying this solution, users only need to choose one of them for deployment according to actual business scenarios.
The Lambda function architecture is designed for serverless architecture, and users only pay for the actual usage.

## Automated Deployment
The following deployment instructions apply to solutions deployed in the Amazon Web Services (Ningxia) region operated by NWCD or the Amazon Web Services (Beijing) region operated by Sinnet. You can use the following link to quickly launch an Amazon CloudFormation stack to deploy and manage this solution.

**Time to deploy**: Approximately 15 minutes. 

### Prerequisites (China Region Only)
This solution uses Amazon API Gateway to receive API call requests, so if you want to provide API requests that can be accessed without authentication in the Beijing region, please make sure that your Amazon Web Services account has passed the Internet Content Provider (ICP) for the record, port 80/443 can be opened normally, please refer to [here](https://s3.cn-north-1.amazonaws.com.cn/sinnetcloud/ICP+recordal/ICP%E5%A4%87%E6 %A1%88%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E.pdf).

### Sign in to Amazon Web Service console

Sign in to the Amazon Web Service Management Console with the IAM permissions (such as: *APIGatewayInvokeFullAcces*).  Please use [Sign in to amazon.com](https://console.aws.amazon.com) to sign in your Amazon Web Services account, for China region via https://console.amazonaws.cn.

### Launch the stack

Open the Amazon Web Services console and use the Region selector in the console navigation bar to launch this solution in a different Amazon Web Service Region. Then, click the applicable link to launch the solution Amazon CloudFormation template. 

You can also download the template as a starting point for your own implementation.
